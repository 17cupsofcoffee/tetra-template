# tetra-template

This repo contains an example of a blank [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra) project.

It comes with some pre-built functionality, based on what I usually want/need when I'm starting a new project:

* Simple asset reloading via a hotkey
* Screen scaling, for chunky pixel graphics

Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own games!
